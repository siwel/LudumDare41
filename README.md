Shooting meets Cooking in Hangover Kitchen. Improve your kitchen's Goggle review by shooting ingredients to the correct customer, completing recipes before they empty your beer stock. Keep your chefâ€™s beer topped up by waking up (kicking out) the hungover customers with exotic food. If all of the beer is gone it's **Game Over.**
